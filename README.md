# LearningOpenGL
Just a repo to track work I've been doing to learn OpenGL. Abstracted the Fragment and Vertex Shader as well as implementing Index Buffers. No real end-game, just messing around. Written in C++ using mingw's g++ to compile.

You can use the Makefile to compile, configured with mingw32. I think everything should run on Linux, of course the Makefile is set with Windows commands. Replace del /f with rm -f to make compatible with Linux.
